# Inductor Design and Characterization Lab

## Overview 

In this the lab, we fabricated an inductor that we designed and verified that it met the design specifications which were as followed:
- 200 μH inductance ±5 percent
- 2 A dc current
- Current to saturate at 100 degrees C: 3 A (minimum)
- 0.40 W maximum power dissipation
- Operating at 10 kHz

We conducted tests to measure the DC resistance and inductance of our inductor at various operating points to verify if it met the specifications.

## Materials 

- 495-5429-ND Core (E25 Core, N27 material)
- 495-5375-ND Bobbin 
- Magnet wire (#20 AWG copper wire)
- Gapping material (paper)
- Analog Discovery and Impedance Analyzer for Analog Discovery
- Auxiliary inductor (5 mH)
- USB isolator module
- Thermal camera

## Background Calculations 

We chose the 495-5429-ND E25 core with N27 material. For N27 material, Bsat = 410mT when temperature T = 100°C and frequency f  = 10kHz.

The volume of the gap is given by the equation:
Vg = u_o * L * (I_max)^2 / B_max^2 = 4πx10^−7*210μH*(2A)^2 / (410mT)^2 = 6.28x10^−9 m^3 for our operating DC current, magnetic field, and desired inductance. 

From the specification for the E25 core, the cross-sectional area is Ac = 52.5mm^2 = 52.5x10^−6 m^2. 
Dividing the desired Vg by our specified cross-sectional area, we got that our desired gap length, lg = 1.19 ∗ 10^−4 m.

For the desired inductance and given dimensions, we calculated the number of turns necessary, with N = sqrt(L*lg/u_o*A_c) = 19.4 turns. 

We rounded up to 20 turns, given a window area of 56.99mm^2 in the core and a packing factor of 0.4. The max bare area of the wire is A_w * 0.4 /N = 56.9 mm^2 * 0.4 / 20 = 0.0138cm^2.

We choose a #20 AWG wire with bare area .005188cm^2. For the #20 AWG wire and given average length per turn from the E25 core datasheet, the resistance of the coil is calculated to be 33.23 * 10^−6 Ω/mm ∗ 20 turns ∗ 50mm/turn = 0.0332 ohms. 

We checked for power with the equation, P = I^2R. At this calculated resistance and max power dissipation of 0.4 W, the max current is 3.47 A. Thus, a minimum saturation current of 3 A is reasonable.

In summary, we used the core 495-5429-ND E25 core, N27 material, bobbin 495-5375-ND, a #20 AWG wire, had 20 turns, and a gap size of 1.19 ∗ 10−4 m. 

## Fabrication

The coil was winded (20 turns) on the plastic bobbin according to design. The insulation was scraped off the ends to make a good connection. The core was assembled with gapping material (paper) to achieve the designed gap size of 1.19 * 10^-4 m. Since there were two gaps, the length of one gap was approximately 0.6 * 10^04 m, so one sheet of paper was used because of it's 0.05 mm thickness. Tape was used to hold it together.

## Results 

### Characterization

The Impedance Analyzer was used for Analog Discovery to measure the inductance and resistance of our inductor. The Digilent Waveforms software was downloaded and installed. The Analog Discovery was then connected to our computer using the USB isolator module, which protected our computer from unwanted overvoltages and overcurrents. The Impedance Analyzer for Analog Discovery measured the impedance of two port elements. DC resistance and inductance was measured using the Analog Discovery.

#### Measuring inductance with a superimposed DC current

The test setup diagrammed in Fig. 1 was used to measure the inductance with the superimposed DC current between 0 and 3 A. The auxiliary inductor was used to decouple the LCR meter measurement from the power supply, which can interfere with the inductance measurement.
