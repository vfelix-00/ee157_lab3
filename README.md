# Inductor Design and Characterization Lab

## Overview 

In this the lab, we fabricated an inductor that we designed and verified if it met the design specifications which were as followed:
- 200 μH inductance ±5 percent
- 2 A dc current
- Current to saturate at 100 degrees C: 3 A (minimum)
- 0.40 W maximum power dissipation
- Operating at 10 kHz

We conducted tests to measure the dc resistance and inductance of our inductor at various operating points to verify if it met the specifications.
