# Inductor Design and Characterization Lab

## Overview 

In this the lab, we fabricated an inductor that we designed and verified that it met the design specifications which were as followed:
- 200 μH inductance ±5 percent
- 2 A dc current
- Current to saturate at 100 degrees C: 3 A (minimum)
- 0.40 W maximum power dissipation
- Operating at 10 kHz

We conducted tests to measure the DC resistance and inductance of our inductor at various operating points to verify if it met the specifications.

## Materials 

- 495-5429-ND Core (E25 Core, N27 material)
- 495-5375-ND Bobbin 
- Magnet wire (#20 AWG copper wire)
- Gapping material (paper)
- Analog Discovery 
- Impedance Analyzer for Analog Discovery
- Auxiliary inductor (5 mH)
- USB isolator module
- Thermal camera

## Background Calculations 

We chose the 495-5429-ND E25 core with N27 material. For N27 material, Bsat = 410mT when temperature T = 100°C and frequency f  = 10kHz.

The volume of the gap is given by the equation:
Vg = u_o * L * (I_max)^2 / B_max^2 = 4πx10^−7*210μH*(2A)^2 / (410mT)^2 = 6.28x10^−9 m^3 for our operating DC current, magnetic field, and desired inductance. 

From the specification for the E25 core, the cross-sectional area is Ac = 52.5mm^2 = 52.5x10^−6 m^2. 
Dividing the desired Vg by our specified cross-sectional area, we got that our desired gap length was lg = 1.19 ∗ 10^−4 m.

For the desired inductance and given dimensions, we calculated the number of turns necessary, with N = sqrt(L*lg/u_o*A_c) to get a minimum of 19.4 turns. 

We rounded up to 20 turns, given a window area of 56.99mm^2 in the core and a packing factor of 0.4. The max bare area of the wire was A_w * 0.4 /N = 56.9 mm^2 * 0.4 / 20 = 0.0138cm^2.

We choose a #20 AWG wire with bare area .005188cm^2. For the #20 AWG wire and given average length per turn from the E25 core datasheet, the resistance of the coil is calculated to be 33.23 * 10^−6 Ω/mm ∗ 20 turns ∗ 50mm/turn = 0.0332 ohms. 

We checked for power with the equation, P = I^2R. At this calculated resistance and max power dissipation of 0.4 W, the max current is 3.47 A. Thus, a minimum saturation current of 3 A is reasonable.

In summary, we used the core 495-5429-ND E25 core, N27 material, bobbin 495-5375-ND, a #20 AWG wire, had 20 turns, and a gap size of 1.19 ∗ 10−4 m. 

## Fabrication

The coil was winded (20 turns) on the plastic bobbin according to design. The insulation was scraped off the ends to make a good connection. The core was assembled with gapping material (paper) to achieve the designed gap size of 1.19 * 10^-4 m. Since there were two gaps, the length of one gap was approximately 0.6 * 10^04 m, so one sheet of paper was used because of its 0.05 mm thickness. We cut the paper and placed it between the 495-5429-ND E25 cores. We then wrapped Kapton tape around the core and bobbins to hold the inductor together. Lastly, we scraped the insulation off the ends of the terminals.

## Results 

### Characterization

The Impedance Analyzer was used for Analog Discovery to measure the inductance and resistance of our inductor. The Digilent Waveforms software was downloaded and installed. The Analog Discovery was then connected to our computer using the USB isolator module, which protected our computer from unwanted overvoltages and overcurrents. The Impedance Analyzer for Analog Discovery measured the impedance of two port elements. DC resistance and inductance was measured using the Analog Discovery. 

#### DC Resistance 

The DC resistance was measured with respect to frequency using the Impedance Analyzer for Analog Discovery. An USB isolator module was used to protect our computer from the unwanted overvoltages and overcurrents. At 0 Hz, the DC resistance was around 0.0332 ohms. 

However, at higher frequencies, the current traveled through a smaller cross-sectional area of the wire. The physical result of this was that the impedance increased as the frequency increased. This phenomenon is known as the skin effect and happens as the current flows closer to the surface of the wire.

Figures: Inductance varying with frequency with a current of 0 A.

The inductance increased with frequency as expected. This happens because the current flowing through the coils induces a magnetic field which causes a back emf voltage opposing the current flow. This relationship is given by the equation V = L di/dt. The higher the frequency, the higher the rate of change of the current,the higher the back emf voltage, leading to a higher inductance.

#### Measuring inductance with a superimposed DC current

The test setup diagrammed in the figure below was used to measure the inductance with the superimposed DC current between 0 and 3 A. The auxiliary inductor was used to decouple the LCR meter measurement from the power supply, which can interfere with the inductance measurement.

Overall, there was a trend of inductance increasing with frequency. However, after about 2 A, the inductance decreased drastically as the DC current increased, which indicated that the saturation current of this inductor was around 2 A. 

We measured the inductance at a frequency of 10 kHz for varying DC currents and included the plot below to better visualize the saturation current.

Figure: The temperature increased as the current increased. Although the overall impedance decreases as current increases, referencing the power equation of P = I^2 * R, the power dissipated increases as current increases. The power is dissipated as heat, leading to an increase in temperature.

## Analysis Questions

1. From your prelab design, estimate your core and winding losses when your in-
ductor is subjected to a sinusoidal 1 A AC current waveform with a 2 A DC
component. Is your estimate supported by measurements that you recorded in
lab? (Note you will not explicitly do this measurement, but rather infer losses
from DC resistance and your temperature measurements.)

The datasheet for the 495-5429-ND E25 core with N27 material reports a relative core loss of < 59%. The winding losses are given by the equation P = I_rms^2 * R_DC. This means that I_rms = 2 A + 1 A / sqrt(2). The R_DC = 0.0332 ohms and the P_winding is estimated to be about 0.243 W. This was actually supported by our measurements. Our measurements demonstrated that the resistance increases as frequency increases. Therefore, we could also expect winding losses to increase as frequency increases. From our temperature measurements, there is an average increase of about 0.92 °C per amp increase in current. For a RMS voltage of 2.707 A, an increase of 1 A would cause the power to increase by 0.213 W. Since copper has a mass of 3.94 g/m and a heat capacity of 0.395 J/g°C, in order to raise our wire by 0.92 degrees, we would need 0.3634 J of energy. If we estimate that the change in temperature per amp takes about 3 seconds, the rate would be 0.121 W which is about 52.4% of the power dissipated from just increasing the current alone. This is reasonable given the <59% given in the datasheet.

2. Does your measured inductor meet the specification? If not, why not? And what
steps could you take to redesign your inductor to meet the specification?

Our inductor had a measured inductance of about 140 μH which was lower than the specification of 200 μH +/- 5%, but it was still of the same magnitude. The saturation current was also lower with about 2 A, instead of the specification of 3 A. This could be due to manufacturing error with the air gap. Inductance and air gap length are inversely proportional. Our larger air gap could've led to a lower inductance. To combat this, we tried to wrap tape around our cores to hold it tightly in place, but it probably wasn't enough to compress to the needed value of 0.0595 mm per gap. Based on our calculations, the experimental air gap was about 0.085mm which had an error of about 42.86%. However, it was difficult to achieve this as the difference was of about 0.0255mm which is a really small scale. We can try to compensate for this by introducing an "expansion factor," ke, to scale lg by 1.4. This changes the number of turns given by the equation N = sqrt(L * lg * ke / u_o * Ac). It turns out, we would have to increase the number of turns to compensate for the air gap error.

3. The “air gap” used is actually a Kapton or paper gap. The Kapton/paper is non-magnetic, and behaves the same as a true air gap. What would happen if aluminum was used for the gapping material?

The permeability of free space is represented by μ0 = 4π * 10^−7 H/m = 1.25663753 * 10^−6 H /m. The permeability of aluminum is  μaluminum = 1.256665 * 10^−6 H/m which is similar to μ0. This makes sense since aluminum isn't magnetic as well. Our values would change only by a little if at all. We might see a very small increase in inductance since the inductance is proportional to the permeability of material in the air gap.
